# My-Portfolio
Feb 2025 Cohort Hackathon 1: Portfolio Challenge ðŸš€
My name is Mustafa. This is my first portfolio that bulit with HTML and CSS
The site includes:
- A responsive navigation with a mobile toggle menu
- About me section with image
- Skills section with categorised skill lists
- Education section with downloadable CV
- Projects showcase with images and links
- Interests section with grid layout
- Contact form
- Footer with social links
The minimal JavaScript included is only for the mobile menu toggle, form submission feedback, and setting the current year in the footer. The styling has been consolidated into a single CSS file with the same color scheme and visual design as the original React version.
